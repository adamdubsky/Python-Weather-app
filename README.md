# Python-Weather-app

This is a simple program I created that shows the user the current weather status in a city they search.
The data is gathered by calling an API from https://openweathermap.org/api
The GUI is created by using tkinter within python.

Simply run the program, enter a city and click enter. 

The orginal program also included a photo icon symbol to show the weather status, removed for this version for simplicity as those files would have to be downloaded
